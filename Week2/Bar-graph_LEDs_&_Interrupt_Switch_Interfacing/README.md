In this experiment, you will interface a Buzzer with the ATmega2560 microcontroller.
Buzzer is already interfaced and present on Firebird V robot.
You are provided with a skeleton code of Buzzer interfacing program.

The program is ideally expected to configure the Buzzer as output device and turn it ON and OFF at an interval of 1 second.
This should repeat itself indefinitely.

The program is provided in a project folder.
But, the program contains few errors which you have to find and debug.
Resolve the errors and build the project.
