AIM:  
In this experiment, we interfaced the Bar-graph LEDs and the Interrupt Switch already present on Firebird V robot.  
The aim of this experiment is to get us familiar with the configuring and interfacing of Input and Output devices.

The task is to toggle the status of 2 Bar-graph LEDs depending on whether the Interrupt Switch is pressed or released.

The program is provided in a project folder.  
But, the program contains few incomplete functions which would have to be completed as per the instructions present in the comments.
