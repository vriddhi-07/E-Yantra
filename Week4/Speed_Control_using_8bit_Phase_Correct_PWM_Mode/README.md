AIM
In this experiment, we will increase and decrease the speed of motors using Phase Correct PWM Mode.  
The aim of this experiment is to get us familiar with one of the PWM mode available on the ATmega2560.

In this experiment, we will interface the L293D motor driver already connected on Firebird V robot and the Timer connected to the ATmega2560.

The program is provided in a project folder.  
But, the program contains few incomplete functions which have to be completed as per the instructions present in the comments.  
The functions necessary for initialization of the Motors and PWM Mode in the Timer are already defined and called in the main() function.
