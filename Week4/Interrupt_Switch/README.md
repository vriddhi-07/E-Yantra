AIM:  
In this experiment, we will turn ON the Buzzer present on the Firebird-V when Interrupt Switch is pressed using the Interrupt Switch.  
The aim of this experiment is to get us familiar with interrupts on the ATmega2560.

The program is provided in a project folder.  
But, the program contains few incomplete functions which have to be completed as per the instructions present in the comments.  
The functions necessary for initialization of Buzzer, Interrupt Switch and External Interrupt are already called in the main() function.
